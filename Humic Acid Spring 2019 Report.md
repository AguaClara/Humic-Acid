## Abstract
The Spring 2019 Humic Acid Team will focus on investigating the behaviour of the absorbances of humic-acid clay mixtures. This will be done through a new, recycled flow system. The AccuView spectrophotometer will be used to test the absorbance of humic acid and clay. Humic acid samples of with concentrations of 5mg/L, 10mg/L and 15mg/L will be tested. Clay samples of NTU of 10, 20, 30, and 100 NTU will be tested as well. Influent streams containing both humic acid and clay will then be run through the system, and the absorbance will be analyzed in comparison with pure humic acid and pure clay absorbances.

## Introduction
Natural Organic Matter (NOM) exists in ground and surface waters with various chemical compositions. It is dipolar and can serve as a nutrient for bacteria, viruses, and pathogens, encouraging their re-germination processes. Additionally, NOM produces carcinogenic by-products during the degradation process. It then becomes imperative to remove NOM in water. The amount of NOM in raw water supplies is greater in areas such as Northern Europe and North America. However, there isn't a robust model predicting how NOM behaves in water and thus, there are not effective treatment methods for NOM removal. Limited knowledge in this area affects drinking water treatment significantly. Many researchers believe the role of NOM in water might call for a need to increase coagulant doses.


The Spring 2018 Humic Acid subteam investigated the optimal coagulant dosage for certain humic acid inffluent concentrations and results are shown in Table 1 below:

Table 1: Results from Spring 2018 Humic Acid Team




| Humic Acid Concentration(mg/L) | Optimal Coagulant Dosage(mg/L) |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| 5                              | 1.6-1.8                        |
| 10                             | 1.3                            |


Even though the humic acid concentration doubled, the difference between optimal coagulant dosages was negligible. Therefore, the Team decided to change our research path. Instead of continuing to test optimal coagulant dosage for different humic acid concentrations, the Fall 2018 Team investigated how effluent humic acid concentration changes as coagulant dosage increases at a certain humic acid influent concentration. To determine the effluent humic acid concentration, the Team used AccuView spectrophotometer to measure the flow absorbance and calculated the concentration of corresponding species in the flow with Beer's Law. The results of these experiments enabled the Team to develop relationships between effluent humic acid concentrations and coagulant dosages for a certain humic acid influent concentration. With more available information of NOM in local water supplies, AguaClara could better adjust the coagulant dosage to achieve lower effluent turbidities and save money on coagulant.

In terms of importance to the world in general, the coagulant concentration should not be too high because it is expensive and potentially harmful to the water quality. Too much coagulant will prevent flocculation which is counter-productive. Too little coagulant means the water still potentially has significant levels of humic acid, which will be problematic once chlorine is used to kill bacteria in the water. The humic acid and chlorine will react to form chloroform which is very harmful to humans (Kopfler, F et al.).



## Literature Review
NOM negatively affects water quality in a number of ways. It causes discoloration, taste and odor problems, and biological growth in distribution systems. It also increases the concentration of heavy metals and absorbed organic pollutants. The increased particles in water consequently cause an increase in sludge volumes. Matilainen et al. suggests that optimized coagulation is the major treatment option in decreasing NOM level (2010). However, the nature of NOM has significant effects on the removal efficiency of coagulation. Additionally, the hydrophobic portion of NOM is generally removed more effectively with coagulation than the hydrophilic portion is. The removal efficiency of NOM also depends on several factors such as pH, temperature and coagulant type.

Regarding NOM removal efficiency, Soh et al. isolated dissolved NOM into four organic fractions based on their hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties (very hydrophobic acids, slightly hydrophobic acids, charged hydrophilics, and neutral hydrophilics) (2008). His experiment was designed to determine the impact of alum coagulation on removal of these fractions in conventional water treatment. He found that the alum removed mostly hydrophobic and higher molecular weight components of NOM. This result further verified that the NOM removal efficiency is correlated with the properties of NOM. His study also revealed that, even though alum coagulation removed a large proportion of NOM, a significant amount of the NOM resisted coagulation as well. This implies that NOM removal will not improve significantly at very high coagulant dosage.

Because of the aforementioned factors, such as pH value, that influence NOM removal efficiency, the team needed to design well-controlled experiments to avoid any unexpected variables affecting experimental results. The studies that have been conducted in related fields provide inspiration for experiments the team conducted this semester, such as exploring the optimal coagulant dosage (the dosage which yields the lowest effluent turbidity) at a certain humic acid concentration. Previous research had focused on the general affect of coagulation on humic acid and the subcomponents of NOM, but there have been no comprehensive studies conducted on optimal dosages. As such, this was the primary research focus of then team.


Another research more relevant to current Humic Acid Team is from Yingda Du, a former graduate student at Cornell, was the first to experiment with how effluent turbidity is affected by a combination of coagulant concentration and humic acid concentration. Her thesis paper investigates the effects NOM has on flocculation. Particle size distribution of flocs and effluent turbidity are the two major criteria for determining the effectiveness of flocculation. These two parameters are affected by the concentration of NOM in the system. In order to model this system, humic acid, which is one of the major components of NOM, serves as the surrogate for NOM. Du hypothesized that variation in humic acid concentration will affect floc size distribution and effluent turbidity. In her thesis, she modeled the effects of humic acid in high turbidity water on flocculation. For influent turbidity at 50 NTU with coagulant dosage ranging from 0.53mg/L to 2.65mg/L and humic acid concentration ranging from 0 to 15mg/L, a series of experiments from Yingda indicate that the coagulant dosage is positively correlated with turbidity reduction and the presence of humic acid greatly increases the effluent turbidity. This was same for every experiment. An increase in coagulant dosage decreased the settled water turbidity.

Another finding from Du's report is that the presence of humic acid increases the frequency of smaller particles after flocculation. As humic acid coats coagulant nano-particles, the attachment efficiency of collisions will decrease. Thus, humic acid can change the particle size distribution of the precipitated solids and larger particle formation is greatly inhibited by humic acid. This result indicates that existence of humic acid particles could diminish the performance of flocculation/sedimentation process with higher effluent turbidity.


## Previous Work
The Humic Acid Team was established in Fall 2017 and in that semester, the team members tested the optimal coagulant dosage at 5mg/L humic acid influent concentration and obtained 1.6mg/L as the optimal coagulant dosage.

The Spring 2018 Humic Acid subteam verified the previous semester's result and tested optimal coagulant dosages for 5m/L and 10mg/L HA concentrations. The results are shown in Table 1 above. As the HA concentration increases, the optimal coagulant dosage drops down slightly. However, the team cannot conclude that the increasing of HA concentration will decrease the optimal coagulant dosage, as a wider range of HA concentrations should be tested. In addition, the team found that for one trial, the head loss through the flocculator accumulates with time. This phenomenon might explain why the effluent turbidity rises up again after the experiment reaches steady state.


The Fall 2018 Humic Acid subteam introduced the spectrophotomer into the experimental apparatus.  This was done in order investigate the applicability of UV-spectroscopy in quantifying the concentration of humic acid in water streams.  The team ran several tests with humic acid (HA for short) solutions of 5 mg/L, 10 mg/L, and 15 mg/L through the 1600 UV spectrophotometer in the design lab at 254 nm. Results from this first preliminary test showed that there is a linear relationship between absorbance and humic acid concentration (equation of the line found to be y=0.227x + 0.262 through linear regression; y is absorbance, x is concentration of HA). This result proved that HA solution obeyed Beer's Law, and spectrsocopy could be used to determine humic acid concentration.

Humic acid solutions were then run through the AccuView spectrophotomer and an absorbance curve was plotted. The final preliminary experiment conduced was done with clay.  Clay mixtures were run through the turbidity meter and spectrophotmeter.  Results showed that the turbifity and absorbance of clay were related linearly. The relationship was obtained: y = 0.0199x + 0.0554, where y is the absorbance and x is the turbidity of clay. This relationship implies by measuring the effluent turbidity of a clay sample, the absorbance of clay can be calculated using the equation above. Fall 2018's work in using absorbance gives future teams data for future spectroscopy work.
