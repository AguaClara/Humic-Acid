## Abstract
The Spring 2018 Humic Acid subteam seeks to experimentally pinpoint the optimal coagulant concentration needed to promote the removal of different concentrations of humic acid from water. Currently, the team has tested five different coagulant concentrations: .3, .5, .8, 1 and 1.3 mg/L for a humic acid concentration of 5 mg/L. Based on previous work, the optimal coagulant concentration appears around 1.5 mg/L. For future work, the team plans to test more coagulant concentrations and vary the humic acid concentration to at least 10 and 15 mg/L. By the end of the semester a mathematical model should be set up for the relationship between optimal coagulant dosage and humic acid concentration.


## Introduction
Natural Organic Matter (NOM) is found in all ground and soil waters. There has been an increase in the amount of NOM in raw water supplies in areas. NOM in water can serve as nutrients for bacterias, viruses, and pathogens, which encourages their re-germination processes. Additionally, NOM produces by-products during the degradation process, which had previously been identified as carcinogenic. It then becomes imperative to remove NOM in water. Currently, there isn't a robust model that predicts how NOM behaves in water and thus, there are not effective treatment methods for NOM removal. Knowledge of this area is very limited, which consequently affects drinking water treatment significantly. The role of NOM in water might call for a need to increase coagulant doses.

AguaClara technology recently started including NOM in the water treatment model. NOM consists of several components and approximately 70\% of dissolved organic carbon, a major component of NOM, is made up of humic acid materials. This is the main reason that humic acid molecules serve as an experimental model for dissolved NOM. Humic acid molecules are macromolecules and are usually 30-40 nm in diameter. It is hypothesized that these macromolecules stick on to, or potentially "coat", the coagulant particles. Due to this effect, the coagulant particles are hindered from forming flocs with the clay particles.

The previous research has used humic acid to mimic NOM performance in water treatment process and found the negative correlation between effluent turbidity and coagulant dosage for controlled influent turbidity and humic acid concentration. The Fall 2017 humic acid team tested optimal effluent turbidity for 5mg/L HA concentration by varying the coagulant dosages (0.5mg/L-2.5mg/L), and concluded that lowest effluent turbidity occurred at around 1.5mg/L coagulant concentration. However, due to time constraint, the previous team did not conduct enough trials for different coagulant concentrations and only 5mg/L HA concentration was investigated. Therefore, the Spring 2018 team will test more coagulant levels (in a broader range) at certain humic acid concentration than the previous team, for a more defined relationship between coagulant dose and effluent turbidity with humic acid existing. In addition, the optimal coagulant concentration will be explored for more humic acid concentrations( 5mg/L, 10mg/L and 15mg/L) so that the team could develop a mathematical model for optimal coagulant dosage at different humic acid concentration, which may have some practical values for AguaClara plant application.


## Literature Review and Previous Work

NOM negatively affects water quality by causing discoloration, taste and odor problems, promoting biological growth in distribution systems, increasing heavy metals, absorbed organic pollutants’ concentration and coagulant doses. The increased particles in water consequently cause an increase in sludge volumes. Matilainen et al. [(2010)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000186861000120X) suggests that optimized coagulation is the major treatment option in decreasing NOM level. However, the nature of NOM has significant effects on the removal efficiency of coagulation. Additionally, the hydrophobic portion of NOM is generally removed more effectively with coagulation than does the hydrophilic portion. The effectiveness of flocculation on the removal of NOM also depends on several factors such as pH, temperature and coagulant type.

Soh et al. [(2008)](http://wst.iwaponline.com/content/58/6/1173) isolated dissolved NOM into four organic fractions based on their hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties (very hydrophobic acids, slightly hydrophobic acids, charged hydrophilics and neutral hydrophilics). This method was to determine the impact of alum coagulation on removal of these fractions in conventional water treatment. He found that the alum removed mostly hydrophobic and higher molecular weight components of NOM. This result further verified that the NOM removal efficiency is correlated with the properties of NOM. His study also revealed that a significant component of the NOM was found to be recalcitrant to this treatment even though alum coagulation removed a large proportion of NOM. This implied that NOM removal will not improve significantly at very high coagulant dosage.

With the aforementioned factors such as pH value that influence NOM removal efficiency, the team needs to design well-controlled experiments to avoid any unexpected variable affecting the experimental results. These studies also provide inspiration for experiments the team plans to conduct this semester, such as exploring the optimal coagulant dosage (the dosage which gives lowest effluent turbidity) at a certain humic acid concentration. Although some previous researches have discussed the existence of optimal coagulant dosage for removing NOM(or humic acid), there is few study concentrating on looking for this optimal coagulant dosage for different humic acid concentrations, which will be explored by the team this semester

Yingda Du’s thesis paper investigates the effects natural organic matter (NOM) has on flocculation. Particle size distribution of flocs and effluent turbidity are the two major criteria for determining the effectiveness of flocculation. These two parameters are affected by the concentration of NOM in the system. In order to model this system, humic acid, which is one of the major components of NOM, serves as the surrogate for NOM. Du hypothesized that variation in humic acid concentration will affect floc size distribution and effluent turbidity. In her thesis, she modeled the effects of humic acids in high turbidity water on flocculation. For influent turbidity at 50 NTU with coagulant dosage ranging from 0.53mg/L to 2.65mg/L and humic acid concentration ranging from 0 to 15mg/L, a series of experiments from Yingda indicate that the coagulant dosage is positively correlated with turbidity removal and the presence of humic acid greatly increases the effluent turbidity. This was same for every experiment. An increase in coagulant dosage decreased the settled water turbidity.

Another finding from Yingda's report is that the presence of humic acid increases the frequency of smaller particles after flocculation.  As humic acid becomes coated with coagulant nano-particles, the attachment efficiency of collisions will decrease. Thus,  humic acid can change the particle size distribution of the precipitated solids and larger particle formation is greatly inhibited by humic acid.

The Fall 2017 humic acid team designed experiments based on Yingda’s research and tested the steady state effluent turbidity for various coagulant concentrations (0.5mg/L, 1mg/L, 1.5mg/L, mg/L and 2mg/L) at 5mg/L HA. The team found that at a low HA concentration, 5 mg/L, the effluent turbidity dropped down and then increased as the coagulant concentration increased. The optimal performance which gave the team the lowest effluent turbidity occurred at around 1.5mg/L. As former AguaClara particle-removal teams have found out, the increasing of coagulant concentration could decrease the steady state effluent turbidity, which was shown as the team increased the coagulant concentration from 0.5mg/L to 1.5mg/L. However, as humic acid particles "coat" on coagulant particles, the increasing in coagulant concentration will give higher optimal effluent turbidity, which was shown as the team increased the coagulant concentration from 1.5mg/L to 2.5mg/L. Based on previous team’s conclusions, the Spring 2018 team decided to further verify this result by retesting steady state effluent turbidity at 5mg/L HA for more choices of coagulant concentrations, so that the team could more accurately know which coagulant concentration(optimal coagulant dosage) gives the team the lowest effluent turbidity. Then more HA concentrations will be tested and the team will analyze optimal coagulant dosage for different HA concentrations.



# Methods
##Experimental Apparatus
To standardize with setup of other particle-removal subteams, 1-inch clear PVC pipe was chosen and
fabricated so that the experimental apparatus has a 50 cm recirculator and 35 cm tube settler. The floc
weir was 40 cm and the bent angle of tube settler was 60 degrees to the horizontal direction. The length
of the tube settler was determined so that the capture velocity of .308 mm/s would be produced at the
end of the reactor.

### Procedure
To run the experiment, we first clean the flocculator tube, the effluent turbidimeter and drain the recirculation unit. Next, we decide a coagulant concentration to test, and input the value into the MathCAD sheet for PAC dosing, which outputs the necessary pump speed. Similarly, we enter the humic acid concentration for the experiment and MathCAD outputs the necessary humic acid pump speed. We then fill the clay bucket with 4-5 liters of water and add Kaolin clay to the bucket. Based on the MathCAD output of the dilution rates for coagulant and humic acid, we prepare the coagulant for 1 liter of deionized water, and the humic acid for 4 liters of deionized water. Once that is all finished, we turn on the clay pump, the water pump, the coagulant pump and the humic acid pump. The water pump is generally ran at 50 RPM and the coagulant and humic acid pumps are varied based on MathCAD output. To tell if our experiment is working, the clay pump should be around 30-40 rpm maximum, and at the end of the experiment the effluent turbidity should be low (~3 NTU). For coagulant concentrations above ~1 mg/L, we expect flocs to form in the recirculation unit.

## Future Work
Completion of our goals and objectives will give AguaClara enough information about humic acid removal for the expansion of this laboratory experiment to a plant scale operation. The use of humic acid to mimic the conditions of the water in the location of AguaClara plants is not completely accurate. This is because there are other particles in natural water that may affect the removal of humic acid and the ability of coagulant to bind to the clay and humic acid particles. If we can complete the humic acid section of experimentation, we can begin to add more particles, along with humic acid, into our experimental water to more closely resemble the source water at AguaClara plants. Eventually a complete understanding of the effects of coagulant on particle removal will allow AguaClara to develop relationships and equations to determine how much coagulant is needed for the proper cleaning of various source waters.
