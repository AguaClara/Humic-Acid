## Abstract
The Spring 2018 Humic Acid subteam seeks to experimentally pinpoint the optimal coagulant concentration needed to promote the removal of different concentrations of humic acid from water. Currently, the team has tested five different coagulant concentrations: 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1 and 1.3 mg/L for a humic acid concentration of 5 mg/L. Based on previous work, the optimal coagulant concentration appears around 1.5 mg/L. For future work, the team plans to test more coagulant concentrations and vary the humic acid concentration to at least 10 and 15 mg/L. By the end of the semester a mathematical model will be set up for the relationship between optimal coagulant dosage and humic acid concentration.

## Introduction
Natural Organic Matter (NOM) exists in  ground and surface waters, with various chemical compositions. It is dipolar and  can serve as nutrients for bacterias, viruses, and pathogens, encouraging their re-germination processes. Additionally, NOM produces carcinogenic by-products during the degradation process. It then becomes imperative to remove NOM in water. The amount of NOM in raw water supplies increases in areas such as North Europe and North America, due to the total amount of NOM increasing in these areas. However, there isn't a robust model predicting how NOM behaves in water and thus, there are not effective treatment methods for NOM removal. Limited knowledge in this area affects drinking water treatment significantly. Many researchers believe the role of NOM in water might call for a need to increase coagulant doses.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Consider not including "soil" in the first sentence. Ground and surface water is clearer.

How is NOM different than the other particles in the water?

This first paragraph is very wordy. Focus on taking out unnecessary words, being direct and concise, and having a focused purpose for every sentence. Use active voice where possible. If you need help with this revision process, come see me at office hours.

Why is there more NOM in raw water supplies in areas? What areas are experiencing this?
</div>

AguaClara technology recently started including NOM in the water treatment model. NOM consists of several components and one major component is dissolved organic carbon. Approximately 70\% of dissolved organic carbon is made up of humic acid materials, which is the main reason that humic acid molecules serve as an experimental model for dissolved NOM. Humic acid molecules are macromolecules and are usually 30-40 nm in diameter. It is hypothesized that these macromolecules stick on to, or potentially "coat", the coagulant particles. Due to this effect, the coagulant particles are hindered from forming flocs with the clay particles.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Good content, but sentence organization makes it hard to read.
</div>

The previous research has used humic acid to mimic NOM performance in the water treatment process and found the negative correlation between effluent turbidity and coagulant dosage for a controlled influent turbidity and humic acid concentration. The Fall 2017 Humic acid subteam tested optimal effluent turbidity for 5mg/L HA concentration by varying the coagulant dosages. However, due to time constraint, the Fall 2017 Humic acid subteam did not conduct enough trials for different coagulant concentrations and only 5mg/L HA concentration was investigated. Therefore, the Spring 2018 Humic Acid subteam will test more coagulant levels (in a broader range) at certain humic acid concentration, for a more defined relationship between coagulant dose and effluent turbidity with humic acid existing. In addition, the optimal coagulant concentration will be explored for more humic acid concentrations( 5mg/L, 10mg/L and 15mg/L) so that the team could develop a mathematical model for optimal coagulant dosages at different humic acid concentrations, which may have some practical values for AguaClara plant application. With more available information of NOM in local water supplies, Aguaclara could better adjust the coagulant dosage to achieve lower effluent turbidities.

## Literature Review and Previous Work

NOM negatively affects water quality in a number of ways. It causes discoloration, taste and odor problems, and biological growth in distribution systems. It also increases the concentration of heavy metals and absorbed organic pollutants. The increased particles in water consequently cause an increase in sludge volumes. Matilainen et al.  suggests that optimized coagulation is the major treatment option in decreasing NOM level [(2010)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000186861000120X). However, the nature of NOM has significant effects on the removal efficiency of coagulation. Additionally, the hydrophobic portion of NOM is generally removed more effectively with coagulation than the hydrophilic portion is. The removal efficiency of NOM also depends on several factors such as pH, temperature and coagulant type.

Reorganize the list in the first sentence to be more fluid.

Explicitly say how flocculation leads to the removal of NOM, because right now it seems as though flocculation itself removes the NOM
</div>

Soh et al. isolated dissolved NOM into four organic fractions based on their hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties (very hydrophobic acids, slightly hydrophobic acids, charged hydrophilics and neutral hydrophilics) [(2008)](http://wst.iwaponline.com/content/58/6/1173). His experiment was designed to determine the impact of alum coagulation on removal of these fractions in conventional water treatment. He found that the alum removed mostly hydrophobic and higher molecular weight components of NOM. This result further verified that the NOM removal efficiency is correlated with the properties of NOM. His study also revealed that, even though alum coagulation removed a large proportion of NOM, a significant amount of the NOM resisted coagulation as well. This implies that NOM removal will not improve significantly at very high coagulant dosage.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
What does recalcitrant mean? The last two sentences do not make sense to me. What does it mean?

In the second sentence you refer to "this method," but it can be confusing because you didn't call Soh et al.'s experiments a method.
</div>

Because of the aforementioned factors, such as pH value, that influence NOM removal efficiency, the team needs to design well-controlled experiments to avoid any unexpected variable affecting experimental results. The studies that have been conducted in related fields provide inspiration for experiments the team plans to conduct this semester, such as exploring the optimal coagulant dosage (the dosage which yields the lowest effluent turbidity) at a certain humic acid concentration. Previous research had focused on the general affect of coagulation on humic acid and the subcomponents of NOM, but there have been no comprehensive studies conducted on optimal dosages. As such, this will be the primary research focus of our team.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Numerous inconsistencies with the technical writing.

What did the previous researchers focus on if not the optimal coagulation dosing for different humic acid concentrations?

Is there a way to identify the humic acid concentration in the field that could be used as a parameter for coagulant dose in a plant?
</div>

Yingda Du, a former graduate student at Cornell, was the first to hypothesize that this theoretical optimal dosage existed. Her thesis paper investigates the effects NOM has on flocculation. Particle size distribution of flocs and effluent turbidity are the two major criteria for determining the effectiveness of flocculation. These two parameters are affected by the concentration of NOM in the system. In order to model this system, humic acid, which is one of the major components of NOM, serves as the surrogate for NOM. Du hypothesized that variation in humic acid concentration will affect floc size distribution and effluent turbidity. In her thesis, she modeled the effects of humic acid in high turbidity water on flocculation. For influent turbidity at 50 NTU with coagulant dosage ranging from 0.53mg/L to 2.65mg/L and humic acid concentration ranging from 0 to 15mg/L, a series of experiments from Yingda indicate that the coagulant dosage is positively correlated with turbidity removal and the presence of humic acid greatly increases the effluent turbidity. This was same for every experiment. An increase in coagulant dosage decreased the settled water turbidity.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">

</div>

Another finding from Yingda's report is that the presence of humic acid increases the frequency of smaller particles after flocculation.  As humic acid becomes coated with coagulant nano-particles, the attachment efficiency of collisions will decrease. Thus,  humic acid can change the particle size distribution of the precipitated solids and larger particle formation is greatly inhibited by humic acid.

The Fall 2017 Humic Acid subteam designed experiments based on Yingda’s research and tested the steady state effluent turbidity for various coagulant concentrations (0.5mg/L, 1mg/L, 1.5mg/L, mg/L and 2mg/L) at 5mg/L HA. The team found that at a low HA concentration, 5 mg/L, the effluent turbidity dropped down and then increased as the coagulant concentration increased. The optimal performance which gave the team the lowest effluent turbidity occurred at around 1.5mg/L. As former AguaClara particle-removal teams have found out, the increasing of coagulant concentration could decrease the steady state effluent turbidity, which was shown as the team increased the coagulant concentration from 0.5mg/L to 1.5mg/L. However, as humic acid particles "coat" on coagulant particles, the increasing in coagulant concentration will give higher optimal effluent turbidity, which was shown as the team increased the coagulant concentration from 1.5mg/L to 2.5mg/L. Based on previous team’s conclusions, the Spring 2018 team decided to further verify this result by retesting steady state effluent turbidity at 5mg/L HA for more choices of coagulant concentrations, so that the team could more accurately know which coagulant concentration(optimal coagulant dosage) gives the team the lowest effluent turbidity. Then more HA concentrations will be tested and the team will analyze optimal coagulant dosage for different HA concentrations.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
So the humic acid particles coat the coagulant particles and causes them to be less efficient, requiring greater coagulant dosage for the same reduction in turbidity.

I don't understand why at a certain coagulant dosage, the effluent turbidity begins to rise again. This last paragraph contradicts itself in places and does not make a compelling argument based off of last semester's work that the effluent turbidity increases as coagulant dose increases after a certain threshold.

# Methods
##Experimental Apparatus
To standardize with setup of other particle-removal subteams, 1-inch clear PVC pipe was chosen and
fabricated so that the experimental apparatus has a 50 cm recirculator and 35 cm tube settler. The floc
weir was 40 cm and the bent angle of tube settler was 60 degrees to the horizontal direction. The length
of the tube settler was determined so that the capture velocity of .308 mm/s would be produced at the
end of the reactor.

### Procedure
To run the experiment, we first clean the flocculator tube, the effluent turbidimeter and drain the recirculation unit. Next, we decide a coagulant concentration to test, and input the value into the MathCAD sheet for PAC dosing, which outputs the necessary pump speed. Similarly, we enter the humic acid concentration for the experiment and MathCAD outputs the necessary humic acid pump speed. We then fill the clay bucket with 4-5 liters of water and add Kaolin clay to the bucket. Based on the MathCAD output of the dilution rates for coagulant and humic acid, we prepare the coagulant for 1 liter of deionized water, and the humic acid for 4 liters of deionized water. Once that is all finished, we turn on the clay pump, the water pump, the coagulant pump and the humic acid pump. The water pump is generally ran at 50 RPM and the coagulant and humic acid pumps are varied based on MathCAD output. To tell if our experiment is working, the clay pump should be around 30-40 rpm maximum, and at the end of the experiment the effluent turbidity should be low (~3 NTU). For coagulant concentrations above ~1 mg/L, we expect flocs to form in the recirculation unit.

Is the turbidity supposed to be around 3 NTU at the end of the experiment (like when it is nearly over) or do you mean after the sed tank (near the end of the apparatus)?

## Results and Analysis
The Spring 2018 Humic Acid subteam tested the steady-state effluent turbidity at 5mg/L HA concentration and 100 NTU influent turbidity. At every trial, the team varied the coagulant dosage from 0.3mg/L, 0.5mg/L, 0.8mg/L, 1mg/L, 1.3mg/L, 1.5mg/L, 1.6mg/L, 1.8mg/L to 2mg/L. The effluent turbidity vs time fraction graphs were plotted for every trial.

![HA1](HA1.PNG)
Figure 4: Effluent turbidity changes for different coagulant dosages at 5mg/L HA concentration.

From the graph above, the team concluded that the optimal coagulant dosage for 5mg/L HA occur at 1.6mg/L(dark blue curve) to 1.8mg/L(red curve), as both curves approach 0.8 NTU at steady state and stay below other curves. This result is consistent with the optimal coagulant dosage(1.5mg/L) investigated last semester. But as Spring 2018 Humic Acid subteam chose smaller increment for coagulant dosage change, the result obtained from this semester (1.6mg/L to 1.8mg/L) should be more accurate. The team did not choose to explore any further after 2mg/L coagulant dosage because the goal of this semester is only to find the optimal coagulant dosage.

The team also noticed some curves rise up after the steady state and after consulted with advisors, the team wished to determine if head loss over flucculator was the cause. Therefore, the team installed the pressure sensor between the influent and effluent of the flucculator. The head loss vs time fraction graph was plotted for 0.8mg/L coagulant, 5mg/L HA experiment.

![pressuredrop](pressuredrop.PNG)
Figure 5: The pressure head loss change over the flucculator.

From the graph above, the pressure head loss increases steadily as the experiment runs. As experiment runs, clay particles would stick on the flucculator's wall and friction inside the flucculator will increase. The flow will experimence more pressure drop due to the thinner path. The two curves on Figure 5 follow very similar patterns, meaning that head loss increasing might explain why the effluent turbidity increases after the steady state.

## Conclusions
Currently, Spring 2018 Humic Acid subteam found the optimal coagulant dosage at 5mg/L HA and 100 NTU influent is 1.6mg/L to 1.8mg/L. This result is consistent with the result reported by Fall 2017 Humic Acid subteam. More conclusions will be updated after the 10mg/L HA +various coagulant dosages experiments.

In addition, the team found that for one trial, as the effluent turbidity increases after the steady state, the pressure head loss also increases. Therefore, the head loss accumulation could be the reason why the effluent turbidity cannot stay steady for a very long time.

## Future Work
Completion of our goals and objectives will give AguaClara enough information about humic acid removal for the expansion of this laboratory experiment to a plant scale operation. The use of humic acid to mimic the conditions of the water in the location of AguaClara plants is not completely accurate. This is because there are other particles in natural water that may affect the removal of humic acid and the ability of coagulant to bind to the clay and humic acid particles. If we can complete the humic acid section of experimentation, we can begin to add more particles, along with humic acid, into our experimental water to more closely resemble the source water at AguaClara plants. Eventually a complete understanding of the effects of coagulant on particle removal will allow AguaClara to develop relationships and equations to determine how much coagulant is needed for the proper cleaning of various source waters. Coagulant concentration should also not be too high because it is unnecessary and potentially harmful to the water quality. Too much coagulant will prevent flocculation which is counter-productive to our goal of removing humic acid.Too little coagulant means the water still potentially has significant levels of humic acid, which will be problematic once chlorine is used to kill bacteria in the water, because the humic acid and chlorine will react to form chloroform which is very harmful to the human liver and humans in general.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Good long term goals and future work and great connection back to why this matters to AguaClara.

Another small aspect of the importance to AguaClara plants is that you want to dose the coagulant correctly so that you're not overdosing and spending extra money, and you're also not underdosing and producing unacceptable water.

### Experimental Methods
1. Choose the experimental set-up by talking with other particle-removal subteams to decide what components are essential. The various experimental setups have different locations of pumps and numbers of pumps because they are for different subteams, but general components are necessary to determine from other subteams. For example, having a recirculator, pumps, turbidimeters and a clay bucket are essential. Construct the recirculator and flocculator. The recirculator was constructed from clear PVC piping, and fabricated to have custom joints, which were connected with adhesive. The flocculator is made from plastic tubing, which is coiled around a cardboard cylinder.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">

</div>

2. Set up the ProCoDA by determining what pumps and turbidimeters need to be controlled based on experimentation purposes. For our experiment, we pump humic acid, water, and coagulant at constant rates, so they don't need to be controlled directly by ProCoDA. The turbidimeters and pressure sensor are also linked to ProCoDA because we need the data to be measured in order to formulate an analysis of whether or not our removal system is effective. On the other hand, the clay pump does need to be controlled by ProCoDA because the clay rate is not constant. Our experimental purposes are to pump in specific concentrations of humic acid and coagulant and observe the effluent turbidity, which is why we need ProCoDA, because it allows us to see what happens to the effluent turbidity as the experiment runs to steady state, and what the effluent turbidity is at the experimental steady state.

</div>

3. Start experiments
  * Collect data through ProCoDA and upload to Google Drive
    - The experiment run time varies with each experiment but we usually run the experiment until the clay runs out, which takes about 15 hours.
  * Adjust experimental designs based on results
    - For example, if the results are not good because the coagulant ran out, the dilution factor for the coagulant can be changed to make the coagulant last longer, so the experiment has more time to reach steady state.
  * Multiple trials should be conducted
    - To verify data is able to be reproduced, multiple trials for each coagulant concentration should be carried out, and the results should be compared for consistency in effluent turbidity.
  * Data Analysis
    - This consists of looking at the excel sheet of data, and searching for the steady state in the data, which is where the effluent turbidity reaches a constant value, which is typically around 1 NTU. Then we plot the data from the start of the experiment until the steady state ends, which is when either coagulant or clay or humic acid runs out, which can be seen by a spike in effluent turbidity after a steady state.

### Cleaning Procedure
  1. Clean flocculator: insert a tiny piece of sponge into one end of flocculator and connect that end to tap water by a push connecter. Turn on the sink and let the sponge run through. This should be done after every trial.
  2. Clean turbidimeter: take out the glass vial from the turbidimeter and wash the vial using soap and a brush. Wipe the vial before putting it back into the turbidimeter. This should be done after every trial. The glass vial in the turbidimeter should be cleaned with kimwipes before returning the vial to the turbidimeter, because the kimwipes remove any fingerprints and potential interference to passing light through the clear vial. If the vial isn't cleaned properly, the effluent turbidity will likely appear higher than it actually is, because fingerprints will lower transmittance of light through the glass vial, which is how the turbidimeter measures turbidity. The less light that passes through the vial, the higher the effluent turbidity, because cloudy water prevents light from completely passing through to the other side of the vial. Fingerprints would essentially act like cloudy water in this case, and prevent light from passing through the vial, thus increasing the effluent turbidity.

  <div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
  Remind them to wipe it with the special wipes and be extra careful to clean it fully.
