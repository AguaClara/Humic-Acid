## Abstract
The Spring 2018 Humic Acid subteam seeks to experimentally pinpoint the optimal coagulant concentration needed to promote the removal of different concentrations of humic acid from water. Currently, the team has tested different coagulant concentrations: 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.8, 2.0 mg/L for a humic acid concentration of 5 mg/L and again for a humic acid concentration of 10mg/L. Based on previous work, the optimal coagulant concentration appears around 1.5 mg/L. For future work, the team plans to test more coagulant concentrations and vary the humic acid concentration to at least 15 mg/L. By the end of the fall 2018 semester a mathematical model will be set up for the relationship between optimal coagulant dosage and humic acid concentration.

## Introduction
Natural Organic Matter (NOM) exists in  ground and surface waters, with various chemical compositions. It is dipolar and can serve as a nutrient for bacteria, viruses, and pathogens, encouraging their re-germination processes. Additionally, NOM produces carcinogenic by-products during the degradation process. It then becomes imperative to remove NOM in water. The amount of NOM in raw water supplies is greater in areas such as Northern Europe and North America, due to a larger presence of NOM in these areas. However, there isn't a robust model predicting how NOM behaves in water and thus, there are not effective treatment methods for NOM removal. Limited knowledge in this area affects drinking water treatment significantly. Many researchers believe the role of NOM in water might call for a need to increase coagulant doses.


AguaClara technology recently started including NOM in the water treatment model. NOM consists of several components and one major component is dissolved organic carbon. Approximately 70\% of dissolved organic carbon is made up of humic acid, which is the main reason that humic acid molecules serve as an experimental model for dissolved NOM. Humic acid molecules are macromolecules that are 30-40 nm in diameter. It is hypothesized that these macromolecules stick on to, or potentially "coat", the coagulant particles. As a result, the coagulant particles have a harder time forming flocs with the clay particles.

The previous research has used humic acid to emulate NOM performance in the water treatment process and found a negative correlation between effluent turbidity and coagulant dosage for a controlled influent turbidity and humic acid concentration. The Fall 2017 Humic acid subteam tested optimal effluent turbidity for 5mg/L HA concentration by varying the coagulant dosages. However, due to time constraint, the Fall 2017 Humic acid subteam did not conduct enough trials for different coagulant concentrations and only 5mg/L HA concentration was investigated. Therefore, the Spring 2018 Humic Acid subteam will test a broader range of coagulant doses at certain HA concentration for multiple humic acid concentrations. Then the team could establish a relationship between coagulant dose and effluent turbidity in the presence of humic acid. The optimal coagulant concentration will be explored for more humic acid concentrations( 5mg/L, 10mg/L and 15mg/L) so that the team can develop a mathematical model for optimal coagulant dosages at different humic acid concentrations, which may have some implication for AguaClara plant application. With more available information of NOM in local water supplies, Aguaclara could better adjust the coagulant dosage to achieve lower effluent turbidities and save money on coagulant.


## Literature Review and Previous Work

NOM negatively affects water quality in a number of ways. It causes discoloration, taste and odor problems, and biological growth in distribution systems. It also increases the concentration of heavy metals and absorbed organic pollutants. The increased particles in water consequently cause an increase in sludge volumes. Matilainen et al.  suggests that optimized coagulation is the major treatment option in decreasing NOM level [(2010)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000186861000120X). However, the nature of NOM has significant effects on the removal efficiency of coagulation. Additionally, the hydrophobic portion of NOM is generally removed more effectively with coagulation than the hydrophilic portion is. The removal efficiency of NOM also depends on several factors such as pH, temperature and coagulant type.

Soh et al. isolated dissolved NOM into four organic fractions based on their hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties (very hydrophobic acids, slightly hydrophobic acids, charged hydrophilics, and neutral hydrophilics) [(2008)](http://wst.iwaponline.com/content/58/6/1173). His experiment was designed to determine the impact of alum coagulation on removal of these fractions in conventional water treatment. He found that the alum removed mostly hydrophobic and higher molecular weight components of NOM. This result further verified that the NOM removal efficiency is correlated with the properties of NOM. His study also revealed that, even though alum coagulation removed a large proportion of NOM, a significant amount of the NOM resisted coagulation as well. This implies that NOM removal will not improve significantly at very high coagulant dosage.

Because of the aforementioned factors, such as pH value, that influence NOM removal efficiency, the team needs to design well-controlled experiments to avoid any unexpected variables affecting experimental results. The studies that have been conducted in related fields provide inspiration for experiments the team plans to conduct this semester, such as exploring the optimal coagulant dosage (the dosage which yields the lowest effluent turbidity) at a certain humic acid concentration. Previous research had focused on the general affect of coagulation on humic acid and the subcomponents of NOM, but there have been no comprehensive studies conducted on optimal dosages. As such, this will be the primary research focus of our team.



Yingda Du, a former graduate student at Cornell, was the first to experiment with how effluent turbidity is affected by a combination of coagulant concentration and humic acid concentration. Her thesis paper investigates the effects NOM has on flocculation. Particle size distribution of flocs and effluent turbidity are the two major criteria for determining the effectiveness of flocculation. These two parameters are affected by the concentration of NOM in the system. In order to model this system, humic acid, which is one of the major components of NOM, serves as the surrogate for NOM. Du hypothesized that variation in humic acid concentration will affect floc size distribution and effluent turbidity. In her thesis, she modeled the effects of humic acid in high turbidity water on flocculation. For influent turbidity at 50 NTU with coagulant dosage ranging from 0.53mg/L to 2.65mg/L and humic acid concentration ranging from 0 to 15mg/L, a series of experiments from Yingda indicate that the coagulant dosage is positively correlated with turbidity reduction and the presence of humic acid greatly increases the effluent turbidity. This was same for every experiment. An increase in coagulant dosage decreased the settled water turbidity.



Another finding from Du's report is that the presence of humic acid increases the frequency of smaller particles after flocculation.  As humic acid coats coagulant nano-particles, the attachment efficiency of collisions will decrease. Thus,  humic acid can change the particle size distribution of the precipitated solids and larger particle formation is greatly inhibited by humic acid.

The Fall 2017 Humic Acid subteam designed experiments based on Yingda’s research and tested the steady state effluent turbidity for various coagulant concentrations (0.5mg/L, 1mg/L, 1.5mg/L, mg/L and 2mg/L) at 5mg/L HA. The team found that at a low HA concentration, 5 mg/L, the effluent turbidity dropped down and then increased as the coagulant concentration increased. The optimal performance which gave the team the lowest effluent turbidity occurred at around 1.5mg/L. As former AguaClara particle-removal teams have found out, the increasing of coagulant concentration could decrease the steady state effluent turbidity, which was shown as the team increased the coagulant concentration from 0.5mg/L to 1.5mg/L. However, as humic acid particles "coat" coagulant particles, the increased coagulant concentration will yield a higher effluent turbidity, which was shown as the team increased the coagulant concentration from 1.5mg/L to 2.5mg/L. This was counter to Du's initial research which showed that increasing coagulant concentrations strictly decreased effluent turbidity. Based on the previous team’s conclusions, the Spring 2018 team decided to further verify this result by retesting steady state effluent turbidity at 5mg/L HA with a greater number of coagulant concentrations, so that the team could more accurately determine which coagulant concentration (optimal coagulant dosage) gives the team the lowest effluent turbidity. Then more HA concentrations will be tested and the team will analyze optimal coagulant dosage for different HA concentrations.


# Methods
##Experimental Apparatus
To standardize with setup of other particle-removal subteams, 1-inch clear PVC pipe was chosen and fabricated so that the experimental apparatus has a 50 cm recirculator (14) and 35 cm tube settler(15). The floc weir was 40 cm and the bent angle of tube settler was angled 60 degrees relative the horizontal. The length of the tube settler was determined so that a capture velocity of .308 mm/s would be produced at the end of the reactor. The design is obtained from High Rate Sedimentation subteam.



![Equipment](Tubesettler.JPG)
Figure 1: The standardized sedimentation tank.

Four pumps (1,2,3,7) were used to drive the tap water, clay water (8), humic acid solution (10) and coagulant solution(12). Two turbidimeters (5,6) were used to measure the turbidity of influent (5) and effluent (6) streams.

The team finished the experimental apparatus set-up as shown below in Figure 3.



![Apparatus](Apparatus.JPG)
Figure 3: The actual apparatus set up.

First, the water pump (1) pumps DI-water into the system where it flows into the flow accumulator (11). Clay water (8) is added to the stream immediately after where it then enters the influent turbidimeter (5). The turbdimeter and the clay pump work together with ProCoDA to regulate the amount of clay pumped into the system, so that influent NTU hovers around 100. The coagulant (12) is added to the stream afterwards, right before the solution enters the flocculator (4). The flocculator accelerates the solution as to maximize clay coagulant collisions. The solution then flows in the tube settler, recirculator complex shown by Figure 1. Once the floc blanket forms, clean water flows through the effluent turbidimeter (6), and then out the waste pipe.



### Procedure
To run the experiment we
* clean the flocculator tube and the effluent turbidimeter
* drain the recirculation unit
* decide a coagulant concentration to test
* input the value into the MathCAD sheet for PACl dosing, which outputs the necessary pump speed
* enter the humic acid concentration for the experiment into MathCAD, which outputs the necessary humic acid pump speed
* fill the clay bucket with 4-5 liters of water and add Kaolin clay to the bucket (2-3 scoops/exact amount isn't important because clay concentration is controlled by ProCoDA)
* Based on the MathCAD output of the dilution rates for coagulant and humic acid, prepare the coagulant stock solution with 4 liters of deionized water, and the humic acid with 4 liters of deionized water
* turn on the clay pump, the water pump, the coagulant pump and the humic acid pump. The clay pump is turned on by ProCoDa and other pumps are turned on manually by pressing the switch.The water pump is generally ran at 50 RPM and the coagulant and humic acid pumps are varied based on MathCAD output
 * the clay pump should be around 30-40 rpm maximum, and at the end of the experiment the effluent turbidity should be low (less than 3 NTU) and in a steady state. An experiment could last anywhere from 12 to 24 hours. For coagulant concentrations above ~1 mg/L, we expect flocs to form in the recirculation unit



## Results and Analysis
The Spring 2018 Humic Acid subteam tested the steady-state effluent turbidity at 5mg/L HA concentration and 100 NTU influent turbidity. At every trial, the team varied the coagulant dosage from 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, 1.8 to 2mg/L. The effluent turbidity vs time fraction graphs were plotted for every trial.



![exp1](exp1.png)
Figure 4: Effluent turbidity changes for different coagulant dosages at 5mg/L HA concentration.


From figure 4, the team concluded that the optimal coagulant dosage for 5mg/L HA occurs at 1.6mg/L (dark blue curve) to 1.8mg/L (red curve), as both curves approach 0.8 NTU at steady state and stay below other curves. This result is consistent with the optimal coagulant dosage (1.5mg/L) investigated last semester. But as Spring 2018 Humic Acid subteam chose smaller increments for coagulant dosage change, the result obtained from this semester (1.6mg/L to 1.8mg/L) should be more accurate. The team did not choose to explore any further after 2mg/L coagulant dosage because the goal of this semester is only to find the optimal coagulant dosage.

![exp2](exp2.png)
Figure 5: Effluent turbidity changes for different coagulant dosages at 10mg/L HA concentration.

From figure 5, the team concluded that the optimal coagulant dosage for 10mg/L occurs at 1.3mg/L (grey curve). The optimal effluent turbidity began to rise again at 1.5 mg/L so the experiment didn't continue after 1.5mg/L coagulant dosage. Most notably, this concentration is less than the optimal dosage for a 5mg/L humic acid concentration. This result shows as the HA concentration increases, the optimal coagulant dosage decreases. Before we can attempt to explain why this might be happening, we need to find the optimal dosage for more humic acid concentrations. This is so we can label this set of experiments as either an anomaly or find some physical explanation.



The team also noticed some curves rise up after the steady state and after consulting with advisors, installed a pressure sensor between the influent and effluent of the flocculator to determine if head loss was the cause. As the tubing of flocculator is relatively thin and particles inside the flowing water could stick on the tubing, the flowing water is likely to experience pressure drop (head loss). The head loss vs time fraction graph was plotted for 0.8mg/L coagulant, 5mg/L HA experiment. Across the duration of the experiment, head loss increases at the same time effluent turbidity did, suggesting that it is a possible source of experimental error.



![pressuredrop](pressuredrop.PNG)
Figure 5: The pressure head loss change over the flocculator.



As experiment runs, particles stick on the flocculator's wall and friction inside the flocculator increases. The flow experiences a greater pressure drop due to the thinner path. The two curves on Figure 5 follow very similar patterns, meaning that head loss increasing might explain why the effluent turbidity increases after the steady state.



## Conclusions
The Spring 2018 Humic Acid subteam found the optimal coagulant dosage at 5mg/L HA and 100 NTU influent is 1.6mg/L to 1.8mg/L. This result is consistent with the result reported by Fall 2017 Humic Acid subteam. For 10mg/L HA, the optimal coagulant dosage is 1.3mg/L. As the HA concentration increases, the optimal coagulant dosage drops down. However, more HA concentrations should be tested to verify this statement.

In addition, the team found that for one trial, as the effluent turbidity increases after the steady state, the pressure head loss also increases. Therefore, the head loss accumulation could be the reason why the effluent turbidity cannot stay steady for a very long time.

In terms of importance to the world in general, our coagulant concentration should not be too high because it is expensive and potentially harmful to the water quality. Too much coagulant will prevent flocculation which is counter-productive .Too little coagulant means the water still potentially has significant levels of humic acid, which will be problematic once chlorine is used to kill bacteria in the water, because the humic acid and chlorine will react to form chloroform which is very harmful to humans.

The use of humic acid to mimic the conditions of the water in the location of AguaClara plants is not completely accurate. This is because there are other particles in natural water that may affect the removal of humic acid. These other particles also affect the ability of coagulant to bind to the clay and humic acid particles. If the team can complete the humic acid section of experimentation, then the team can begin to add more particles, along with humic acid, into the team's experimental water. This allows us to more closely resemble the source water at AguaClara plants.



## Future Work
Completion of the team's goals and objectives will give AguaClara enough information about humic acid removal, for the expansion of this laboratory experiment to a plant scale operation. Eventually a complete understanding of the effects of coagulant on particle removal will allow AguaClara to develop relationships and equations. These equations will be used to determine how much coagulant is needed for the proper cleaning of various source waters. More specifically, the mathematical model the team will create will relate humic acid concentration to optimal coagulant concentration. Currently the team only has optimal coagulant dosages for two different HA concentrations, meaning that we have two points for this relationship. Once the team plots this data for various results, we can predict what coagulant level we'll need to remove any humic acid concentration. For the very next step, the team will test optimal coagulant dosage for more HA concentrations and then, the team could develop the mathematical model in the future.

# **Manual**
### Experimental Methods
1. Choose the experimental set-up to standardize with other particle-removal subteams. Construct the recirculator and flocculator. The recirculator was constructed from clear PVC piping. The floc weir was attached to the recirculator with adhesive. The flocculator is made from plastic tubing, which is coiled around a cardboard cylinder.



2. Set up ProCoDA by determining what pumps and turbidimeters needed to be controlled based on experimentation purposes. For our experiment, we pump humic acid, water, and coagulant at constant rates, so they don't need to be controlled directly by ProCoDA. We just turn on or off these pumps manually by pressing the block switch on the pump. The turbidimeters and pressure sensor are also linked to ProCoDA to collect output data. On the other hand, the clay pump does need to be controlled by ProCoDA because the influent turbidity should keep at 100NTU. The clay pump is on while the ProCoDA program is operating.



3. Start experiments
  * We collect data through ProCoDA and upload to Google Drive
    - The experiment run time varies so that we need to prepare stock solutions for at least 20-hour run time.
  * We adjust experimental designs based on results
    - For example, if the run time is long than our expectation, the dilution factor for the stock solution can be changed so the experiment has more time to reach steady state.
  * We will conduct multiple trials
    - To verify data is able to be reproduced, multiple trials for each coagulant concentration should be carried out, and the results should be compared for consistency in effluent turbidity.
  * Data Analysis
    - This consists of us looking at the excel sheet of data, and searching for the steady state in the data, which is where the effluent turbidity reaches a constant value. Then we plot the data from the start of the experiment until the steady state ends.
  * Note any observations and results while experimenting.



### Cleaning Procedure
  1. Clean flocculator: insert a tiny piece of sponge into one end of flocculator and connect that end to tap water by a push connecter. Turn on the sink and let the sponge run through. This should be done after every trial.
  2. Clean turbidimeter: take out the glass vial from the turbidimeter and wash the vial using soap and a brush. Wipe the vial before putting it back into the turbidimeter. This should be done after every trial. The glass vial in the turbidimeter should be cleaned with kimwipes before returning the vial to the turbidimeter, because the kimwipes remove any fingerprints and potential interference to passing light through the clear vial. If the vial isn't cleaned properly, the effluent turbidity will likely appear higher than it actually is, because fingerprints will lower transmittance of light through the glass vial, which is how the turbidimeter measures turbidity. The less light that passes through the vial, the higher the effluent turbidity, because cloudy water prevents light from completely passing through to the other side of the vial. Fingerprints would essentially act like cloudy water in this case, and prevent light from passing through the vial, thus increasing the effluent turbidity.

### Experimental Checklist
Before starting the experiment:
* Make sure ProCoDA is connected, and appropriately set up for data collection
* Check that the stock solutions are adequately filled
* Check that all tubing is connected properly, and no leaks are present in the system

For ~5 minutes after starting the experiment:
* Make sure the influent turbidity has stabilized around 100 NTU
* Also check that the clay pump is below 80 RPM

Later during the experiment:
* Floc blankets should have formed in the recirculator
* Check that there is still coagulant, clay and humic acid in their respective containers
* Ensure that effluent turbidity is getting significantly lower as time progresses
