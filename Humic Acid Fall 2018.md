## Abstract
In Spring 2018 the Humic Acid Team dedicated to pinpoint the optimal coagulant concentration needed to promote the removal of different concentrations of humic acid from water. The team tested coagulant dosages ranging from 0.3mg/L to 2mg/L for 5mg/L and 10mg/L HA concentrations, but did not observe strong trend between the optimal coagulant dosage and HA concentration. The Fall 2018 Humic Acid Team will continue previous semester's research, testing optimal coagulant dosage for 15mg/L HA and modifying the mathematical model of optimal coagulant dosage vs HA concentration.
## Introduction
Natural Organic Matter (NOM) exists in ground and surface waters, with various chemical compositions. It is dipolar and can serve as a nutrient for bacteria, viruses, and pathogens, encouraging their re-germination processes. Additionally, NOM produces carcinogenic by-products during the degradation process. It then becomes imperative to remove NOM in water. The amount of NOM in raw water supplies is greater in areas such as Northern Europe and North America, due to a larger presence of NOM in these areas. However, there isn't a robust model predicting how NOM behaves in water and thus, there are not effective treatment methods for NOM removal. Limited knowledge in this area affects drinking water treatment significantly. Many researchers believe the role of NOM in water might call for a need to increase coagulant doses.

The Spring 2018 Humic Acid subteam found the optimal coagulant dosage at 5mg/L HA and 100 NTU influent is 1.6mg/L to 1.8mg/L, and for 10mg/L HA, the optimal coagulant dosage is 1.3mg/L. The Fall 2018 Team will continue to test for optimal coagulant dosage for 15mg/L HA and gain more information regarding the mathematical model of optimal coagulant dosage vs HA concentration. Then, the team will use spectrophotometer to investigate the HA concentration in effluent and analyze the relationship between the effluent HA concentrations and coagulant dosages for a certain HA influent concentration. With more available information of NOM in local water supplies, AguaClara could better adjust the coagulant dosage to achieve lower effluent turbidities and save money on coagulant.

## Literature Review and Previous Work
NOM negatively affects water quality in a number of ways. It causes discoloration, taste and odor problems, and biological growth in distribution systems. It also increases the concentration of heavy metals and absorbed organic pollutants. The increased particles in water consequently cause an increase in sludge volumes. Matilainen et al. suggests that optimized coagulation is the major treatment option in decreasing NOM level (2010). However, the nature of NOM has significant effects on the removal efficiency of coagulation. Additionally, the hydrophobic portion of NOM is generally removed more effectively with coagulation than the hydrophilic portion is. The removal efficiency of NOM also depends on several factors such as pH, temperature and coagulant type.

Soh et al. isolated dissolved NOM into four organic fractions based on their hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties (very hydrophobic acids, slightly hydrophobic acids, charged hydrophilics, and neutral hydrophilics) (2008). His experiment was designed to determine the impact of alum coagulation on removal of these fractions in conventional water treatment. He found that the alum removed mostly hydrophobic and higher molecular weight components of NOM. This result further verified that the NOM removal efficiency is correlated with the properties of NOM. His study also revealed that, even though alum coagulation removed a large proportion of NOM, a significant amount of the NOM resisted coagulation as well. This implies that NOM removal will not improve significantly at very high coagulant dosage.

Because of the aforementioned factors, such as pH value, that influence NOM removal efficiency, the team needs to design well-controlled experiments to avoid any unexpected variables affecting experimental results. The studies that have been conducted in related fields provide inspiration for experiments the team plans to conduct this semester, such as exploring the optimal coagulant dosage (the dosage which yields the lowest effluent turbidity) at a certain humic acid concentration. Previous research had focused on the general affect of coagulation on humic acid and the subcomponents of NOM, but there have been no comprehensive studies conducted on optimal dosages. As such, this will be the primary research focus of our team.

Yingda Du, a former graduate student at Cornell, was the first to experiment with how effluent turbidity is affected by a combination of coagulant concentration and humic acid concentration. Her thesis paper investigates the effects NOM has on flocculation. Particle size distribution of flocs and effluent turbidity are the two major criteria for determining the effectiveness of flocculation. These two parameters are affected by the concentration of NOM in the system. In order to model this system, humic acid, which is one of the major components of NOM, serves as the surrogate for NOM. Du hypothesized that variation in humic acid concentration will affect floc size distribution and effluent turbidity. In her thesis, she modeled the effects of humic acid in high turbidity water on flocculation. For influent turbidity at 50 NTU with coagulant dosage ranging from 0.53mg/L to 2.65mg/L and humic acid concentration ranging from 0 to 15mg/L, a series of experiments from Yingda indicate that the coagulant dosage is positively correlated with turbidity reduction and the presence of humic acid greatly increases the effluent turbidity. This was same for every experiment. An increase in coagulant dosage decreased the settled water turbidity.

Another finding from Du's report is that the presence of humic acid increases the frequency of smaller particles after flocculation. As humic acid coats coagulant nano-particles, the attachment efficiency of collisions will decrease. Thus, humic acid can change the particle size distribution of the precipitated solids and larger particle formation is greatly inhibited by humic acid.

The Spring 2018 Humic Acid subteam tested optimal coagulant dosages for 5m/L and 10mg/L HA concentrations and found the optimal coagulant dosage at 5mg/L HA and 100 NTU influent is 1.6mg/L to 1.8mg/L, which is  consistent with the result reported by Fall 2017 Humic Acid subteam. For 10mg/L HA, the optimal coagulant dosage is 1.3mg/L. As the HA concentration increases, the optimal coagulant dosage drops down slightly. However, the team cannot conclude that the increasing of HA concentration will decrease the optimal coagulant dosage, as more different HA concentrations should be tested.

In addition, the team found that for one trial, the head loss through the flocculator accumulates with time. This phenomenon might explain why the effluent turbidity rises up again after the experiment reaches steady state.

In terms of importance to the world in general, our coagulant concentration should not be too high because it is expensive and potentially harmful to the water quality. Too much coagulant will prevent flocculation which is counter-productive .Too little coagulant means the water still potentially has significant levels of humic acid, which will be problematic once chlorine is used to kill bacteria in the water, because the humic acid and chlorine will react to form chloroform which is very harmful to humans.

The use of humic acid to mimic the conditions of the water in the location of AguaClara plants is not completely accurate. This is because there are other particles in natural water that may affect the removal of humic acid. These other particles also affect the ability of coagulant to bind to the clay and humic acid particles. If the team can complete the humic acid section of experimentation, then the team can begin to add more particles, along with humic acid, into the team's experimental water. This allows us to more closely resemble the source water at AguaClara plants.







## Methods
Explain the techniques you have used to acquire additional data and insights. Reserve fine detail for the Manual at the end of the report, but use this section to give an overview with enough detail for the reader to understand your Results and Analysis. Describe your apparatus, and have a justification for every decision you made and every parameter you chose in the design of the apparatus. Be especially careful to detail the conditions your experiments were conducted under, as this information is especially important for interpreting your results

Below, some example sections are given. Sectioning the report is meant to keep similar information together.  Continue making sections as necessary, or delete sections if you do not need them. Feel free to add subsubsections to further delineate the information. For example, under the Experimental Apparatus section below, the EStaRS team might consider having sections such as "Filter Design" and "Filter Fabrication".

### Experimental Apparatus
Explain your apparatus setup using enough detail such that future teams can recreate your apparatus. Make sure to explain why you built it this way. Create a schematic drawing of the apparatus (not a photo) that has clearly labeled components, flow paths, sensors, and reactor geometry.
* Design (calculations, constraints)

  $\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
* Schematic (label parts)

  <img src="https://github.com/jillianwhiting/Jillian-Whiting/blob/master/Images/IMG_0009.jpg?raw=true" height=250 width=200>

* Image (from lab; label parts)
* Materials (dimensions, materials)
* Complications in construction
* If already constructed: write a brief summary of important constraints, include any revisions to apparatus, also reference the prior report where construction is described

### Procedure
Discuss your experimental procedure. How did you run your experiment? What were you testing? What were the values of relevant parameters?

## Results and Analysis
Present an observation (results), then explain what happened (analysis).  Each paragraph should focus on one aspect of your results. In that same paragraph, you should interpret that result.  
In other words, there should not be two distinct paragraphs, but instead one paragraph containing one result and the interpretation and analysis of this result. Here are some guiding questions for results and analysis:

When describing your results, present your data, using the guidelines below:
* What happened? What did you find?
* Show your experimental data in a professional way.
```python
from aide_design.play import*
x = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
y = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
plt.figure('ax',(10,8))
plt.plot(x,y,'*')
plt.savefig('/Users/jillianwhiting/github/Jillian-Whiting/Images/linear')
plt.show()
```
![linear](https://github.com/jillianwhiting/Jillian-Whiting/blob/master/Images/linear.png?raw=true)
Figure 1: Captions are very important for figures. Captions go below figures.

### Figure requirements
 - Create the graph using python (not Excel)
 - If the x axis is time then make zero time reflect the beginning of the test.
 - Use a white background for all graphs.
 - Most data will have both x and y values and thus should be presented using an xy scatter plot.
 - Label all axes and include units where appropriate.
 - Axis scale labels should be in the margin of the graph and not inside the graph border.
 - Eliminate parts of the range in both x and y axis that aren't used or that aren't meaningful.
 - Place a caption with a brief description below the graph. Add this caption using the wiki formatting, not in your graphing software.
 - Use data symbols to show data points unless there is so much data that the symbols overlap. If the data symbols overlap it is better to connect the data points with a line and not show the data symbols.
 - When presenting multiple plots on a single graph make sure that it is easy to distinguish the plots using the legend.
 - If curve fitting is used explain why and include the equation (elsewhere in the report).
 - If a model or theoretical curve is presented it should be a smooth curve without data points.
 - Use the same font in the graphs as you use in the text of the report.
 - Insert the graph in your report after the first reference to it in the text. Inserted the graph after the next paragraph break
 - Scale the size of the graph so it is large enough to see the data and read the text without having to follow a link to see a larger image. Avoid using hyperlinks on images because that causes the export to Microsoft Word option to not include the image.

After describing a particular result, within a paragraph, go on to connect your work to fundamental physics/chemistry/statics/fluid mechanics, or whatever field is appropriate. Analyze your results and compare with theoretical expectations; or, if you have not yet done the experiments, describe your expectations based on established knowledge. Include implications of your results. How will your results influence the design of AguaClara plants? If possible provide clear recommendations for design changes that should be adopted. Show your experimental data in a professional way using the following guidelines:
* Why did you get those results/data?
* Did these results line up with expectations?
* What went wrong?
* If the data do not support your hypothesis, is there another hypothesis that describes your new data?
