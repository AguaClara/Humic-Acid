## Abstract
The Fall 2019 Humic Acid subteam seeks explore the relationship between optimal coagulant dosages and effluent absorbance. Past teams have tested optimal concentration for removing HA. Based on previous work, the optimal coagulant concentration appears naround 1.5 mg/L. For this semester, the team plans to test more coagulant concentrations and humic acid concentration and find the optimal dosage to lower the absorbance of the effluence. The AccuView spectrophotometer will be used to measure the effluent absorbance and measure the efficiency of removing color. The concentrations of HA and coagulant is set based on the data collected from water plants. 

## Introduction
Natural Organic Matter (NOM) exists in ground and surface waters with various chemical compositions. It is dipolar and can serve as a nutrient for bacteria, viruses, and pathogens, encouraging their re-germination processes. Additionally, NOM produces carcinogenic by-products during the degradation process. It then becomes imperative to remove NOM in water. The amount of NOM in raw water supplies is greater in areas such as Northern Europe and North America. However, there is not a robust model predicting how NOM behaves in water and thus, there are not effective treatment methods for NOM removal. Limited knowledge in this area affects drinking water treatment significantly. Many researchers believe the role of NOM in water might call for a need to increase coagulant doses.

In terms of importance to the world in general, the coagulant concentration should not be too high because it is expensive and potentially harmful to the water quality. Too much coagulant will prevent flocculation which is counter-productive. Too little coagulant means the water still potentially has significant levels of humic acid, which will be problematic once chlorine is used to kill bacteria in the water. The humic acid and chlorine will react to form chloroform which is very harmful to humans (Kopfler, F et al.).



## Literature Review
Natural organic matter (NOM) negatively affects water quality in a number of ways. It causes discoloration, taste and odor problems, and biological growth in distribution systems. It also increases the concentration of heavy metals and absorbed organic pollutants. The increased particles in water consequently cause an increase in sludge volumes. Matilainen et al.(2010) suggests that optimized coagulation is the major treatment option in decreasing NOM level. However, the nature of NOM has significant effects on the removal efficiency of coagulation. Additionally, the hydrophobic portion of NOM is generally removed more effectively with coagulation than the hydrophilic portion is. The removal efficiency of NOM also depends on several factors such as pH, temperature and coagulant type.

According to Zhang et al.(2008), polyaluminum chlorides (PAC) are some of the most effective and efficient coagulants in water treatment. They are largely used in place of traditional aluminous coagulants due to their high efficiency at low dosages, low cost, and convenient usage. 

Regarding NOM removal efficiency, Soh et al.(2008) isolated dissolved NOM into four organic fractions based on their hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties (very hydrophobic acids, slightly hydrophobic acids, charged hydrophilics, and neutral hydrophilics). His experiment was designed to determine the impact of alum coagulation on removal of these fractions in conventional water treatment. He found that the alum removed mostly hydrophobic and higher molecular weight components of NOM. This result further verified that the NOM removal efficiency is correlated with the properties of NOM. His study also revealed that, even though alum coagulation removed a large proportion of NOM, a significant amount of the NOM resisted coagulation as well. This implies that NOM removal will not improve significantly at very high coagulant dosage.

Because of the aforementioned factors, such as pH value, that influence NOM removal efficiency, the team needed to design well-controlled experiments to avoid any unexpected variables affecting experimental results. The studies that have been conducted in related fields provide inspiration for experiments the team will conduct this semester, such as exploring the optimal coagulant dosage (the dosage which yields the lowest effluent turbidity) at certain humic acid concentrations. Previous research focused on the general effect of coagulation on humic acid and the subcomponents of NOM, but there have been no comprehensive studies conducted on optimal dosages. Therefore, the primary focus of this experiment will be on the optimal dosage of coagulant and floc blanket formation of humic acid and coagulant without the addition of clay. 

More relevant research to the current Humic Acid Team is from Yingda Du (2017), a former graduate student at Cornell. Du was the first to experiment with how effluent turbidity is affected by a combination of coagulant concentration and humic acid concentration. Her thesis paper investigates the effects NOM has on flocculation. Particle size distribution of flocs and effluent turbidity are the two major criteria for determining the effectiveness of flocculation. These two parameters are affected by the concentration of NOM in the system. In order to model this system, humic acid, which is one of the major components of NOM, serves as the surrogate for NOM. Du hypothesized that variation in humic acid concentration will affect floc size distribution and effluent turbidity. In her thesis, she modeled the effects of humic acid in high turbidity water on flocculation. For influent turbidity at 50 NTU with coagulant dosage ranging from 0.53 mg/L to 2.65 mg/L and humic acid concentration ranging from 0 to 15 mg/L, a series of experiments from Yingda indicate that the coagulant dosage is positively correlated with turbidity reduction and the presence of humic acid greatly increases the effluent turbidity. This was same for every experiment. An increase in coagulant dosage decreased the settled water turbidity.

Another finding from Du's report is that the presence of humic acid increases the frequency of smaller particles after flocculation. As humic acid coats coagulant nano-particles, the attachment efficiency of collisions will decrease. Thus, humic acid can change the particle size distribution of the precipitated solids and larger particle formation is greatly inhibited by humic acid. This result indicates that existence of humic acid particles could diminish the performance of flocculation/sedimentation process with higher effluent turbidity.

## Previous Work

The Humic Acid Team was established in Fall 2017 and in that semester, the team members tested the optimal coagulant dosage at 5 mg/L humic acid influent concentration and obtained 1.6 mg/L as the optimal coagulant dosage.
The Spring 2018 Humic Acid subteam verified the previous semester's result and tested optimal coagulant dosages for 5m/L and 10 mg/L HA concentrations. The results are shown in Table 1 above. As the HA concentration increases, the optimal coagulant dosage drops down slightly. However, the team cannot conclude that the increasing of HA concentration will decrease the optimal coagulant dosage, as a wider range of HA concentrations should be tested. In addition, the team found that for one trial, the head loss through the flocculator accumulates with time. This phenomenon might explain why the effluent turbidity rises up again after the experiment reaches steady state.

The Fall 2018 Humic Acid subteam introduced the spectrophotomer into the experimental apparatus. This was done in order to investigate the applicability of UV-spectroscopy in quantifying the concentration of humic acid in water streams. The team ran several tests with humic acid (HA for short) solutions of 5 mg/L, 10 mg/L, and 15 mg/L through the 1600 UV spectrophotometer in the design lab at 254 nm. Results from this first preliminary test showed that there is a linear relationship between absorbance and humic acid concentration. This result proved that HA solution obeyed Beer's Law, and spectroscopy could be used to determine humic acid concentration. Humic acid solutions were then run through the AccuView spectrophotomer and an absorbance curve was plotted. The final preliminary experiment conducted was done with clay.

Clay mixtures were run through the turbidity meter and spectrophotometer. Results showed that the turbidity and absorbance of clay were related linearly. The team obtained the relationship y=0.0199x+0.0554, where y is the absorbance and x is the turbidity of clay. This equation implies by measuring the effluent turbidity of a clay sample, the absorbance of clay can be calculated using the equation above. Fall 2018's work in using absorbance gives future teams data for future spectroscopy work.

The Spring 2019 Humic Acid subteam developed a mathematical model that related the concentration of clay and humic acid to the stream’s absorbance and turbidity. The model [HA] + [Clay] = 0.00103x + 0.4280, where x is the measured turbidity, could be used to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the AguaClara plants in removing humic acid from water. The team determined that humic acid and clay streams did not have additive absorbances, so the observed absorbance was not equivalent to the projected combined absorbance of the two streams. While the team expected the absorbance to decrease with increasing clay concentration, because of the clay’s ability to coagulate humic acid particles, the results indicated that the observed absorbance was actually greater than the projected absorbance. The team decided that further research would be required to reach a definite conclusion.




## Methods
### Experimental Apparatus
To standardize with setup of other particle-removal subteams, 1-inch clear PVC pipe was chosen and fabricated so that the experimental apparatus has a 50 cm recirculator and 35 cm tube settler. The floc weir was 40 cm and the bent angle of tube settler was angled 60 degrees relative the horizontal. The length of the tube settler was determined so that a capture velocity of .308 mm/s would be produced at the end of the reactor. The design is obtained from High Rate Sedimentation subteam.

Figure 1: A schematic drawing of our experimental set-up


As shown in figure 1, our experimental set-up relies on four main variables: the pumps, the flocculator, the sedimentation tank, and the spectrophotometer. We have three pumps, one is for our coagulant stock (PACl), one is for our HA stock, and the final pump is connected to the water supply. Each pump transports the desired concentration from our stock solutions into the system. The effluent from the HA and water pumps are connected and flow into a turbidity meter. This is done to measure the absorbance of HA before the water is treated so as to compare it to the final absorbance of the water. We use a turbidity meter instead of a spectrophotometer because we do not have a second spectrophotometer at hand, and absorbance can be derived from the HA/water mixture’s turbidity. Then, the coagulant, HA and water flow through the flocculator (the initial step of the treatment process where the flocs are formed) and into the sedimentation tank (where the floc blanket will form). The waste will fall into the tube settler and flow into the wastewater pipe while the treated water will rise to the top and flow through the spectrophotometer. The absorbance will then be measured, and the effluent will be transported to the wastewater pipe.

### Procedure
To run the experiment we: 

* clean the flocculator tube and the effluent turbidimeter and spectrophotometer
* drain the recirculation unit
* decide a coagulant and humic acid concentration to test
* input the value into the python code, which outputs the necessary pump speed
* enter the humic acid concentration for the experiment into python code, which outputs the necessary humic acid pump speed
* fill both humic acid and coagulant stock buckets with at least 3-4 litres
* turn on the the water pump, the coagulant pump and the humic acid pump. The coagulant and humic acid pump speed is controlled by procoda. The water pump is generally manually set to run at 50 RPM. 



## Python Code

### Determining the Pump Speed for a Given Concentration
The team used the following code to calculate the speed of the humic acid, coagulant, and water pumps to achieve the desired concentrations of humic acid and coagulant in the recirculator (going into the spectrophotometer). This code is based on the equation Q<sub>1</sub>C<sub>1</sub>=Q<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, where Q<sub>1</sub> is the initial flow rate, C<sub>1</sub> is the initial concentration, Q<sub>2</sub> is the final flow rate, and C<sub>2</sub> is the final concentration. In order to use this script, the user must input the stock and desired humic acid concentration and the stock and desired coagulant concentration. The upflow velocity in the recirculator is assumed to be 1 mm/s through a 1 in. tube, while the 'yellow-blue' tubing is used for the HA/coag pumps and the ID 17 tubing is used for the water pump.

### Variables
$ vt $: upflow velocity in the recirculator

$ r $: radius of the recirculator tube

$ a $: cross sectional area of the recirculator tube

$ qt $: flow rate through the recirculator

$ cHAs $: stock humic acid concentration (into humic acid pump)

$ cHAd $: desired humic acid concentration in the recirculator

$ qHAs $: stock humic acid flow rate (through humic acid pump)

$ cCGs $: stock coagulant concentration (into coagulant pump)

$ cCGd $: desired coagulant concentration in the recirculator

$ qCGs $: stock coagulant flow rate (through coagulant pump)

$ qW $: flow rate of water in the recirculator

$ vHA $: volume per revolution of the humic acid pump (dependent on pump tubing)

$ sHA $: revolution per second (pump speed) of the humic acid pump

$ vCG $: volume per revolution of the coagulant pump (dependent on pump tubing)

$ sCG $: revolution per second (pump speed) of the coagulant pump

$ vW $: volume per revolution of the water pump (dependent on pump tubing)

$ sW $: revolution per second (pump speed) of the water pump
