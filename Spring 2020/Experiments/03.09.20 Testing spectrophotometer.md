# Testing the spectrophotometer

Recorded by Thomas Bradford (tsb49) on 9 March 2020

## Description 
We want to determine if we should recalibrate the spectrophotometer. So, we're going to run HA through the system and see if the measured numbers are reasonable. If not, we'll recalibrate.

## Conditions

Someone has disconnected a lot of the components of our apparatus. 

### Species 
Concentration of HA in water: 1.03 g / 4.0 L H<sub>2</sub>O 

This corresponds to a **___ g / L** concentration. 

The HA we mixed into the water was a solid hummic acid sodium salt.

### Pumps, Turbidimeters, & Spectrophotometer
Influent water pump: ___ (can be calculated from our Colab functions page)

Effluent water pump: 

HA input: 

Coagulant input:
