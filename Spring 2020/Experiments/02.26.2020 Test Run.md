# Test Run

## Description
After connecting all of the system's pumps and making sure that all of the measurement devices were communicating with ProCoDa, we ran a test experiment to determine if the meters were measuring the right numbers. 

## Conditions

### Species 
Concentration of HA in water: 1.03 g / 4.0 L H<sub>2</sub>O

Note: The volume of water was measured using a bucket with markings in 1 L increments. In the future, we will use 1 L graduated cylinders to maximize precision of our concentration calculations. 

This corresponds to a **0.26 g / L** concentration. 

The HA we mixed into the water was a solid hummic acid sodium salt.
