# Test Run

Recorded by Thomas Bradford (tsb49@cornell.edu).

## Description
After connecting all of the system's pumps and making sure that all of the measurement devices were communicating with ProCoDa, we ran a test experiment to determine if the meters were measuring the right numbers. 

## Conditions

### Species 
Concentration of HA in water: 1.03 g / 4.0 L H<sub>2</sub>O

Note: The volume of water was measured using a bucket with markings in 1 L increments. In the future, we will use 1 L graduated cylinders to maximize precision of our concentration calculations. 

This corresponds to a **0.26 g / L** concentration. 

The HA we mixed into the water was a solid hummic acid sodium salt.

### Pumps, Turbidimeters, & Spectrophotometer
Influent water pump: 8.652 revolutions per minute (can be calculated from colab functions page)

Effluent water pump: 48 revolutions per minute 

HA input: 40.85 revolutions per minute 
Coagulant input:

## Comments on Methods
We ran the method file "2-20-20". 

We receorded comments in real time in the data file that we saved on that date. 

## Comments on Results
Initially, the floc tank was not filling with water. However, we closed off the floc weir, and the tank proceeded to fill. 

The influent turbidimeter's turbidity increased higher than we expected. This may have been because the water in the apparatus was dirty. However, after we waited for a while, the influent turbidity leveled out between 6 and 6.5 NTU.
