# Determining Data Point 1

Recorded by Thomas Bradford (tsb49@cornell.edu) on 12 March 2020

## Description 

Our goal is to get Data Point 1. Data Point 1 is: coagulant concentration (dependent) vs. concentration of humic acid (independent). 

We are going to be determining percent removal of humic acid in relation to influent coagulant concentration.
For a set experiment, we will choose some concentration of humic acid to be constant across the experiment. 
For this concentration of HA, we will then input coagulant of a certain concentration. 
We will measure influent versus effluent content of humic acid, and then calculate percent removal. 

A plot will be made for every given influent concentration of HA. It will plot % HA removal (y axis) versus influent coagulant concentration (x axis).

**Data Point 1** corresponds to ___. This value is lifted from Report 1 for Spring 2020. 

## Conditions

### Species 
Concentration of HA in water: 1.03 g / 4.0 L H<sub>2</sub>O 

This corresponds to a **___ g / L** concentration. 

The HA we mixed into the water was a solid hummic acid sodium salt.

### Pumps, Turbidimeters, & Spectrophotometer
Influent water pump: ___ (can be calculated from our Colab functions page)

Effluent water pump: 

HA input: 

Coagulant input:
