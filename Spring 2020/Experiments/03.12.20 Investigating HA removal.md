# Determining Data Point 1

Recorded by Thomas Bradford (tsb49@cornell.edu) on 12 March 2020

## Description 

Our goal is to get Data Point 1. Data Point 1 is: coagulant concentration (dependent) vs. concentration of humic acid (independent). 

We are going to be determining percent removal of humic acid in relation to influent coagulant concentration.
For a set experiment, we will choose some concentration of humic acid to be constant across the experiment. 
For this concentration of HA, we will then input coagulant of a certain concentration. 
We will measure influent versus effluent content of humic acid, and then calculate percent removal. 

A plot will be made for every given influent concentration of HA. It will plot % HA removal (y axis) versus influent coagulant concentration (x axis).

**Data Point 1** corresponds to 1.5 mg / L PACl. We will test with  HA / L. This value is lifted from Table 1 in Report 1 for Spring 2020. 

## Conditions

### Pumps, Turbidimeters, & Spectrophotometer
Influent water pump: ___ (can be calculated from our Colab functions page)

Effluent water pump: 

HA input: 

Coagulant input: 

## Comments on Methods
We ran the method file "Humic_Acid_Method_Spring_20". 

We receorded comments in real time in the data file that we saved on that date. 

## Comments on Results

Note on 12 March: We will evaluate the results on a later data.
