# Redetermining the linear relationship between HA and absorbance

Recorded by Thomas Bradford (tsb49@cornell.edu) on 12 March 2020

## Description 

The spectrophotometer seems to have been recalibrated since last semester. 

To work around this, we are effectively recalibrating the spectrophotometer. 

We are going to run 3 samples of varying concentrations of HA, and record the spectrophotometer measurements. 

With this data, we will determine the linear relationship between HA content and absorbance. 

### Summary of results 

| Concentration (mg HA / L sample) | Absorbance (AU)|
|:---:|:---:|
| 10| 0.3204 |
|15 | 0.4703|
|20| 0.5868 |
|25|0.7230 |
|30|0.8643 |

Via Excel with a linear regression, this corresponds to: 0.02681 AU / mg HA, with an intercept of 0.05686 AU at 0 mg HA.

### Procedure
We are not using the pumps for this experiment. Our informal procedure was as follows: 

- Make a stock solution of 1 g / L HA
- Calculate the desired volume of stock in order to make the sample's concentration. Each sample's volume is 1 L. 
- Put some of the sample into a cuvette. 
- Insert the cuvette into the spectrophotometer. 
- Record the measured absorbance after it has reached an apparent steady state. 

## Comments on Results
There seems to be a strong linear relationship. 
When we plot the data on Excel, we get an R^2 value of over 0.990, with a y-intercept of around 0.08.
We will plot the data using Python for the sake of the report.
